===========================================================================

This guide provides and introduction to the theory of Statistical Disclosure Control
(SDC) for microdata including an overview of most commonly applied methods in SDC,
a step-by-step overview of the complete SDC process and many examples from practice in NSOs.

For guidance on the technical implementation of the methods, this guide is 
accompanied by two guides on the technical implementation for completing
the SDC process using the *R* package *sdcMicro*. Both guides are
available as Read the Docs documentations: 

(i) |sdcpractice| for using *sdcMicro* from command-line

(ii) |sdcappdocs| for using the GUI *sdcApp* for *sdcMicro*
